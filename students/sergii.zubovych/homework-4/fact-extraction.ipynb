       " Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974.,\n",
       " Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 brought them international success.,\n",
       " The band’s 1977 album News of the World contained \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\", which have become anthems at sporting events.,\n",
       " By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. \",\n",
       " In August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with Queen at Knebworth, England.,\n",
       " Since 2004, May and Taylor have toured under the \"Queen +\" name with vocalists Paul Rodgers and Adam Lambert.,\n",
       " Estimates of Queen's record sales range from 170 million to 300 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists.,\n",
       " Queen received the Outstanding Contribution to British Music Award from the British Phonographic Industry in 1990.,\n",
       " In 2005, Queen received the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Song Collection from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.,\n",
       " In 1970, after Staffell left to join the band Humpy Bong, the remaining Smile members, encouraged by now-member Bulsara, changed their name to \"Queen\" and performed their first gig on 18 July.,\n",
       " On 2 July 1971, Queen played their first show in the classic line-up of Mercury, May, Taylor and Deacon at a Surrey college outside London.,\n",
       " Having attended art college, Mercury also designed Queen's logo, called the Queen crest, shortly before the release of the band's first album.,\n",
       " In 1972, Queen entered discussions with Trident Studios after being spotted at De Lane Lea Studios by John Anthony.,\n",
       " After these discussions, Norman Sheffield offered the band a management deal under Neptune Productions, a subsidiary of Trident, to manage the band and enable them to use the facilities at Trident to record new material, whilst the management searched for a record label to sign Queen.,\n",
       " This suited both parties, as Trident were expanding into management, and under the deal, Queen were able to make use of the hi-tech recording facilities used by other musicians such as the Beatles and Elton John to produce new material.,\n",
       " Roger Taylor later described these  early off-peak studio hours as \"gold dust\".In 1973, Queen signed to a deal with Trident/EMI.,\n",
       " The group's second LP, Queen II, was released in 1974, and features rock photographer Mick Rock's iconic image of the band on the cover.,\n",
       " The album reached number five on the British album chart and became the first Queen album to chart in the UK.,\n",
       " Aside from its only single, the album also included the song \"The March of the Black Queen\", a six-minute epic which lacks a chorus.,\n",
       " Critical reaction was mixed; the Winnipeg Free Press, while praising the band's debut album, described Queen II as an \"over-produced monstrosity\".,\n",
       " AllMusic has described the album as a favourite among the band's hardcore fans, and it is the first of three Queen albums to feature in the book 1001 Albums,\n",

       " 1974–1976: Sheer Heart Attack to A Night at the Opera,\n",
       " Released in 1974, Sheer Heart Attack reached number two in the UK, sold well throughout Europe, and went gold in the US.,\n",
       " At this point, Queen started to move away from the progressive tendencies of their first two releases into a more radio-friendly, song-orientated style.,\n",
       " Stretching contemporary production methods, Sheer Heart Attack introduced new sound and melody patterns.,\n",
       " The single \"Killer Queen\" from Sheer Heart Attack reached number two on the British charts, and became their first US hit, reaching number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100.,\n",
       " It is also the second of three Queen albums to feature in the book 1001 Albums,\n",
       " In late 1975, Queen recorded and released A Night at the Opera, taking its name from the popular Marx Brothers movie.,\n",
       " A Night at the Opera has frequently appeared in \"greatest albums\" lists reflecting the opinions of critics.,\n",
       " A Night at the Opera is the third and final Queen album to be featured in the book 1001 Albums,\n",
       " The first track on A Night at the Opera, \"Death on Two Legs\", is said to have been written by Mercury about Norman Sheffield (and the former management at Trident who helped make the video so popular) because the band was broke despite the success of the previous album.,\n",
       " The band's A Night at the Opera Tour began in November 1975, and covered Europe, the United States, Japan, and Australia.\n",

       " By 1976, Queen were back in the studio recording A Day at the Races, which is often regarded as a sequel album to A Night at the Opera.,\n",
       " It again borrowed the name of a Marx Brothers movie, and its cover was similar to that of A Night at the Opera, a variation on the same Queen logo.,\n",
       " The most recognisable of the Marx Brothers, Groucho Marx, invited Queen to visit him in his Los Angeles home in March 1977; there the band thanked him in person, and performed \"'39\" a cappella.,\n",
       " Musically, A Day at the Races was by both fans' and critics' standards a strong effort, reaching number one in the UK and Japan, and number five in the US.,\n",
       " During 1976, Queen played one of their most famous gigs, a free concert in Hyde Park, London.,\n",
       " On 1 December 1976, Queen were the intended guests on London's early evening,\n",

       " The band's sixth studio album News of the World was released in 1977, which has gone four times platinum in the United States, and twice in the UK.,\n",
       " Queen commenced the News of the World Tour in November 1977, and Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times called this concert tour the band's \"most spectacularly staged and finely honed show\".,\n",
       " In 1978, the band released Jazz, which reached number two in the UK and number six on the Billboard 200 in the US.,\n",
       " Another notable track from Jazz, \"Don't Stop Me Now\", provides another example of the band's exuberant vocal harmonies.,\n",
       " In 1978, Queen toured the US and Canada, and spent much of 1979 touring in Europe and Japan.,\n",
       " Queen also released the very successful single \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\", a rockabilly inspired song done in the style of Elvis Presley.,\n",
       " In December 1979, Queen played the opening night at the Concert for the People of Kampuchea in London, having accepted a request by the event's organiser Paul McCartney.\n",
       " ,\n",
       " The Game to The Works\n",
       " Queen began their 1980s career with The Game.,\n",
       " After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles, Michael Jackson suggested to Mercury backstage that \"Another One Bites the Dust\" be released as a single, and in October 1980 it spent three weeks at number one.,\n",
       " It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album.,\n",
       " In September 1980, Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden.,\n",
       " In 1980, Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for Flash Gordon.,\n",

       " On 24 and 25 November, Queen played two sell out nights at the Montreal Forum, Quebec, Canada.,\n",
       " One of Mercury's most notable performances of The Game's final track, \"Save Me\", took place in Montreal, and the concert is recorded in the live album, Queen Rock Montreal.\n",
       " ,\n",
       " Queen worked with David Bowie on the single \"Under Pressure\".,\n",
       " The first-time collaboration with another artist was spontaneous, as Bowie happened to drop by the studio while Queen were recording.,\n",
       " In October that year, Queen released their first compilation album, titled Greatest Hits, which showcased the group's highlights from 1974 to 1981.,\n",
       " In 1982, the band released the album Hot Space, a departure from their trademark seventies sound, this time being a mixture of rock, pop rock, dance, funk, and R&B.,\n",
       " Q magazine would list Hot Space as one of the top fifteen albums where great rock acts lost the plot.,\n",
       " The band stopped touring North America after their Hot Space Tour, as their success there had waned, although they would perform on American television for the only time during the eighth-season premiere of Saturday Night Live on 25 September of the same year; it became the final public performance of the band in North America before the death of their frontman.,\n",
       " Queen left Elektra Records, their label in the US, Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, and signed onto EMI/Capitol Records.,\n",
       " After working steadily for over ten years, Queen decided that they would not perform any live shows in 1983.,\n",
       " In February 1984, Queen released their eleventh studio album, The Works, which included the successful singles \"Radio Ga Ga\", \"Hammer to Fall\" and \"I Want to Break Free\".,\n",
       " I think we proved that.\"That year, Queen began The Works Tour, the first tour to feature keyboardist Spike Edney as an extra live musician.,\n",
       " Queen donated to a school for the deaf and blind as a philanthropic gesture but were fined by the British Musicians' Union and placed on the United Nations' blacklisted artists.\n",
       " ,\n",
       " 1985–1988: Live Aid and tours\n",
       " In January 1985, Queen headlined two nights of the first Rock in Rio festival at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and played in front of over 300,000 people each night.,\n",
       " Highlights from both nights were released on VHS as Queen: Live in Rio, and was broadcast on MTV in the US.,\n",

       " ,\n",
       " At Live Aid, held at Wembley on 13 July 1985, in front of the biggest-ever TV audience of 1.9 billion, Queen performed some of their greatest hits.,\n",
       " The show's organisers Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, other musicians such as Elton John, Cliff Richard and Dave Grohl, and journalists writing for the BBC, CNN, Rolling Stone, MTV, The Telegraph among others, described Queen as the highlight.,\n",
       " Queen ended 1985 by releasing the single \"One Vision\" and a limited-edition boxed set of Queen albums, The Complete Works.,\n",
       " In early 1986, Queen recorded the album A Kind of Magic, containing several reworkings of songs written for the fantasy action film Highlander.,\n",
       " The album was successful in the UK and many other countries, producing a string of hits including \"A Kind of Magic\", \"One Vision\", \",\n",
       " In mid-1986, Queen went on the Magic Tour, their final tour with Freddie Mercury.,\n",
       " The Magic Tour's highlight was at Wembley Stadium in London and resulted in the live double album Queen at Wembley, released on CD and as a live concert VHS/DVD, which has gone five times platinum in the US and four times platinum in the UK.,\n",
       " Queen could not book Wembley for a third night, but played at Knebworth Park.,\n",

       " Queen began the tour at the Råsunda Stadium in Stockholm, Sweden, and during the tour the band performed a concert at Slane Castle, Ireland, in front of an audience of 95,000, which broke the venue's attendance record.,\n",
       " More than one million people saw Queen on the tour—400,000 in the UK alone, a record at the time.,\n",
       " After working on various solo projects during 1988 (including Mercury's collaboration with Montserrat Caballé, Barcelona), the band released The Miracle in 1989.,\n",
       " The album continued the direction of A Kind of Magic, using a pop-rock sound mixed with a few heavy numbers.,\n",
       " I Want It All\", \"Breakthru\", \"The Invisible Man\", \"Scandal\", and \"The Miracle\".,\n",
